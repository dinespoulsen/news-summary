News Summary Application
==================

Introduction
-------
The News Summary app searches for "business" within all the articles from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a page. Clicking on a headline will shows the full article. The app is designed as a single page web app using frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The app sends a get request to the Guardian API using an XTMLHttp object and the response is translated into a JSON object. The app uses javascript callbacks to handle the execution process of the DOM and to increase the user experience when the layout is rendered to the page.

I can see all of today's headlines in one place
So I know what the big stories of the day are

To make my news reading more fun
